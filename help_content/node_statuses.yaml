      Your node status provides important information about its current operational state. The status indicators appear on your node dashboard and help diagnose potential issues.
      
      This guide explains what each status means and what actions you might need to take.

  - heading: Online Status
    content: |-
      **ðŸŸ¢ Online**: Your node is fully operational and can receive connection requests.
      
      - Successfully connected to the discovery network
      - Service proposals are visible to potential users
      - All required ports are properly configured
      - No further action required - your node is working as expected
      
      This is the ideal state for your node. If your node shows "Online", it means all systems are operational and your node is ready to provide services and earn rewards.

  - heading: Pending Status
    content: |-
      **ðŸŸ¡ Pending**: Your node is registered, but still setting up connections to the network.
      
      Common reasons for Pending status:
      - New node that was just registered (can take up to 24 hours to come online)
      - Recently restarted node that's reestablishing connections
      - Minor network connectivity issues
      
      **Action Required**: Usually none - just wait. If the status persists for more than 24 hours, check your internet connection and firewall settings.

  - heading: Offline Status
    content: |-
      **ðŸ”´ Offline**: Your node is not connected to the network and cannot provide services.
      
      Common reasons for Offline status:
      - Internet connection issues 
      - Router/firewall blocking required ports
      - Mysterium service stopped or crashed
      - Node software needs updating
      
      **Action Required**: Check your internet connection, router settings, and restart your node. Make sure required ports (especially 50000-60000 UDP) are open.

  - heading: Unknown Status
    content: |-
      **âš« Unknown**: The node's status cannot be determined.
      
      Common reasons for Unknown status:
      - New node that hasn't registered on the network yet
      - Communication issue between your node and the discovery service
      - Problems with your node's identity
      
      **Action Required**: Wait 1-2 hours to see if the status resolves. If it persists, restart your node and check your internet connection.

  - heading: Monitoring Failed
    content: |-
      **ðŸŸ  Monitoring Failed**: Your node is online but the network monitoring service cannot connect to it.
      
      Common reasons for Monitoring Failed status:
      - Port forwarding not properly configured
      - Router firewall blocking incoming connections
      - Internet Service Provider (ISP) using CGNAT
      
      **Action Required**: Set up port forwarding for ports 50000-60000 UDP. Use `/help topic monitoring_failed` for detailed troubleshooting steps or `/help topic cgnat` if you suspect you're behind CGNAT.

      The node quality score:
      
      - **Connectivity**: Tests if your node can establish two-way connections
      - **Latency**: Measures network response speed in milliseconds (lower is better)
      - **Uptime**: Measures how long your node has been online (longer is better)
      - **Quality Score**: An overall measurement of your node's reliability and performance
      
      **Action Required**: For best earnings, aim for a high quality score by ensuring good connectivity, low latency, and consistent uptime.
