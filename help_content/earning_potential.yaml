      Your node's earning potential depends on several key factors:
      
      - **Connection Quality**: Higher quality scores attract more traffic
      - **IP Type**: Residential IPs generally earn more than hosting/datacenter IPs
      - **Location**: Some geographic regions have higher demand
      - **Traffic Types**: Different service types have different pricing
      - **Uptime**: Longer, consistent uptime increases reliability and earnings
      - **Node Age**: Established nodes with good history may receive more traffic

      Connection quality is critical for earnings. To improve it:
      
      - **Set up port forwarding**: Make sure ports 50000-60000 are open
      - **Use a wired connection**: Ethernet is more stable than WiFi
      - **Ensure adequate bandwidth**: At least 50 Mbps download/upload is recommended
      - **Minimize latency**: Place your node close to your router
      - **Keep your node updated**: Run the latest version for best performance
      
      Check your quality score in the dashboard. Scores above 2.5 are good, above 2.8 is excellent.

      For the best performance and earnings:
      
      - **Run on dedicated hardware**: Low-power devices like Raspberry Pi are ideal
      - **Ensure 24/7 uptime**: Consistent availability builds reputation
      - **Stable power supply**: Consider UPS for uninterrupted operation
      - **Monitor regularly**: Check your node stats weekly at minimum

  - heading: Location Considerations
    content: |-
      Location impacts earnings significantly:
      
      - **Residential areas**: Generally more valuable than datacenters
      - **Under-served regions**: Less competition can mean more traffic
      - **Different regions**: Traffic demand varies by geographic location
      
      While you can't easily change your location, this explains why earnings might differ between nodes.

  - heading: Patience and Long-term Strategy
    content: |-
      Node running is a marathon, not a sprint:
      
      - **Regular updates**: Keep your node software current
      - **Network growth**: Earnings potential increases with network usage
      - **Stakig**: Staking your earnings can increase your profit.
      
      Many successful node runners report earnings increasing after 3-6 months of consistent operation.
