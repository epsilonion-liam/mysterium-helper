title: Staying Safe as a Node Runner
description: Information about node safety, legal considerations, and protections in place for Mysterium node operators.

      When you run a Mysterium node, you are sharing your internet connection with others:
      
      - Your node becomes part of a decentralized network
      - Users can route their internet traffic through your connection
      - This helps provide privacy and censorship resistance
      - Traffic passes through your IP address but is encrypted
      
      **Important:** Like any VPN or proxy service, this raises questions about traffic content and legal implications.

  - heading: How Node Runners Are Protected
    content: |-
      Mysterium Network has implemented multiple layers of protection for node runners:
      
      1. **Legal Protections:** Node runners are operating as infrastructure providers, similar to ISPs, which in many jurisdictions gives protection under "safe harbor" provisions
      
      2. **B2B Traffic:** By default, nodes only allow traffic to whitelisted domains (unless you specifically disable this)
      
      3. **Service Filtering:** You can choose which services your node supports (B2B, Public, VPN, etc.) 
      
      4. **Advanced Traffic Filtering:** The Mysterium team actively researches and implements filtering technologies

  - heading: Whitelisted Traffic System
    content: |-
      Mysterium's whitelist system is a key protection:
      
      - Enabled by default on all nodes
      - Only allows traffic to domains verified to be legitimate
      - Regularly updated with domains that meet strict criteria
      - Blocks potential problematic traffic
      - This traffic is B2B only, not public VPN traffic
      
      **Note:** You can disable the other traffic such as public and VPN, but this increases risk and is not recommended for most operators.

  - heading: Additional Recommendations
    content: |-
      To maximize your safety as a node operator:
      
      - Keep the whitelist system enabled (B2B traffic)
      - Update your node regularly for the latest safety features
      - Consider running your node in a Docker container for added isolation
      - Use a dedicated device rather than your personal computer
      - Don't keep logs of user traffic
      - Be aware of your local regulations regarding VPN/proxy services

  - heading: Business Entity Protection
    content: |-
      For additional protection, consider:
      
      - Running your node under a registered business entity
      - This may provide additional legal protections in many jurisdictions
      - Allows for proper accounting and tax handling of earnings
