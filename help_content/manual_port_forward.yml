title: Manual Port Forwarding Guide
description: Learn how to manually set up port forwarding for your Mysterium node to improve connectivity and performance.

  - heading: Why Port Forwarding Matters
    content: |-
      Port forwarding allows external traffic to reach your Mysterium node, which:
      - Improves connection quality score
      - Enables better traffic routing
      - Increases your node's accessibility
      - Can help resolve "Connection monitoring failed" errors
      - May improve earnings by making your node more reliable

  - heading: Required Ports
    content: |-
      For optimal performance, your Mysterium node needs these ports forwarded:
      
      - **TCP/UDP Ports 50000-60000 or 50000:60000**: Used for service traffic (Wireguard, DVPN, scraping, etc.)
      - **TCP Port 4449**: Web UI access (optional, local network only)
      
      Port forwarding should be configured on your router to direct traffic to your node's local IP address.

  - heading: Finding Your Router
    content: |-
      1. Find your router's IP address:
         - **Windows**: Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`, look for "Default Gateway"
         - **Linux/Mac**: Open Terminal and type `ip route | grep default`, look for the IP after "via"
         
      2. Access your router by entering this IP address in a web browser (typically 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1)
      
      3. Log in with your router's admin credentials (check router documentation if unknown)

  - heading: Setting Up Port Forwarding
    content: |-
      The exact steps vary by router brand, but generally:
      
      1. Log in to your router's admin panel
      2. Look for "Port Forwarding", "Virtual Server", or "NAT" settings
      3. Add a new port forwarding rule:
         - **Local IP**: Your node device's internal IP address
         - **Local Port**: 50000-60000 or 50000:60000 (UDP)
         - **External Port**: 50000-60000 or 50000:60000
         - **Protocol**: UDP
      
      **Example for popular routers:**
      
      **TP-Link:**
      - Navigate to "Advanced" > "NAT Forwarding" > "Virtual Servers"
      - Add port range 50000-60000 pointing to your node's IP
      
      **Netgear:**
      - Navigate to "Advanced" > "Advanced Setup" > "Port Forwarding"
      - Create custom services for each required port/range

  - heading: Alternative Setup with DMZ
    content: |-
      If individual port forwarding is difficult, you can use DMZ (Demilitarized Zone):
      
      1. In your router settings, find the DMZ option
      2. Enter your Mysterium node's local IP address
      3. Enable the DMZ
      
      **Warning:** DMZ forwards ALL ports to your device, which presents security risks. Only use this for dedicated node devices, not personal computers.
