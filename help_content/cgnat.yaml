title: Am I Behind CGNAT?
description: How to determine if your ISP uses Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT) and what to do if you're behind CGNAT.

    content: |-
      Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT) is a technique used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to conserve IPv4 addresses by sharing a single public IP address among multiple customers.
      
      When you're behind CGNAT:
      - Your connection uses a private IP that's shared with other users
      - You cannot receive incoming connections from the internet
      - Port forwarding will not work
      - Running services that require incoming connections (like Mysterium Node) becomes difficult

      **Method 1: Compare IP Addresses**
      
      1. Check your router's WAN/Internet IP address:
         - Log into your router admin panel (typically 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1)
         - Find the WAN or Internet status page
         - Note the IP address shown
      
      2. Check your public IP address:
         - Visit whatismyip.com or similar website
         - Note the IP address shown
      
      3. **Compare**: If these two IP addresses are different, you're likely behind CGNAT
      
      **Method 2: Check IP Address Range**
      
      If your public IP falls within these ranges, you're behind CGNAT:
      - 100.64.0.0 - 100.127.255.255 (RFC 6598, specifically for CGNAT)
      - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (RFC 1918 private range)
      - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (RFC 1918 private range)
      - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (RFC 1918 private range)

  - heading: Port Forwarding Behind CGNAT
    content: |-
      **Important**: Standard port forwarding CANNOT work if you're behind CGNAT.
      
      When you set up port forwarding on your router, you're only forwarding within your private network, but the CGNAT still blocks incoming connections from reaching your router.
      
      This is why you may experience "Connection monitoring failed" errors on your Mysterium node even after setting up port forwarding correctly on your router.

  - heading: Options for Running a Node Behind CGNAT
    content: |-
      If you confirm you're behind CGNAT, you have several options:
      
      **Contact Your ISP**: 
         - Ask if they can provide a public/static IP address
         - This may require upgrading to a business plan or paying an additional fee

  - heading: Check with Your ISP
    content: |-
      If you suspect you're behind CGNAT, contact your ISP's support and ask:
      
      1. "Does my connection use Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)?"
      2. "Can I get a public IP address for my connection?"
      3. "Is there a fee for a static or public IP address?"
      
      Be prepared to explain why you need a public IP address - for running a legitimate privacy service node.
