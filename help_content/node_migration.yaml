      **Important**: Migration preserves your node's identity and earnings history, but does NOT transfer your unclaimed balance. Make sure to claim any funds before migrating!
      
      You'll need:
      - Access to both your old and new devices
      - Your node identity backup (or access to the old node)
      - A new device with supported OS (Linux/Windows/Mac/RaspberryPi)

  - heading: Step 1: Back Up Your Identity
    content: |-
      On your old node, access the backup:
      
      **Via Web UI** (recommended):
      1. Open the web UI at http://[node-ip]:4449/
      2. Go to Settings â†’ Backup
      3. Click "Download" to save your backup file
      
      **Via CLI** (advanced users):
      ```
      myst cli
      > identities list
      > identities get [identity] --backup
      ```
      
      Save the resulting backup file securely.

  - heading: Step 2: Stop the Old Node
    content: |-
      Before migrating, properly stop your old node:
      
      **For Docker installations:**
      ```
      docker stop myst
      ```
      
      **For Linux native installations:**
      ```
      sudo systemctl stop mysterium-node
      ```
      
      **For Windows/macOS:**
      Stop the service from the system tray or services panel

  - heading: Step 3: Install Mysterium on New Device
    content: |-
      Install the Mysterium Node on your new device using any of the available installation methods:
      
      - Docker: Use `/help topic docker_install`
      - Linux: Use `/help topic linux_install`
      - Or download the app from mystnodes.com
      
      **Important:** Don't complete the initial setup yet! Stop after installation.

  - heading: Step 4: Restore Your Identity
    content: |-
      **Via Web UI:**
      1. Access the UI at http://[new-node-ip]:4449/
      2. During initial setup, select "Import Existing Identity"
      3. Upload your backup file and enter your password
      
      **Via CLI (advanced):**
      ```
      myst cli
      > identities import [path-to-backup-file]
      ```

  - heading: Step 5: Complete Setup
    content: |-
      After restoring your identity:
      
      1. Complete the configuration steps for your new node
      2. Verify your node is visible in the proposal list
      3. Check that your earnings history is preserved
      
      **Note:** It may take up to 24 hours for your node to fully reconnect to the network and appear in discovery.
