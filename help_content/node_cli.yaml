      The Mysterium CLI is a powerful tool for managing your node directly through terminal commands.
      
      **For Docker installations:**
      ```
      docker exec -it myst myst cli
      ```
      
      **For native installations (Linux/macOS/Windows):**
      ```
      myst cli
      ```
      
      You'll see a prompt like `[myst] >` when successfully connected.
